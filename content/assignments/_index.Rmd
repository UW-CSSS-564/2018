## Overview

Assignments will be distributed and submitted using GitHub.

Each assignment will have three steps:

1.  Initial submission
1.  Corrections (1 week after peer review)

### Initial Submission

Submissions of all assignments should include both an R Markdown file and a compiled PDF file. Each assignment should be forked from the assignment repository, and submitted with a pull request. More detailed instructions are [here](https://github.com/UW-CSSS-564/assignment-2018-0).

The initial submission will be graded on the following 4-category scale:

| 4  | exceptional, above and beyond what was expected        |
| 3  | effort made to complete all questions; mostly correct  |
| 2  | some effort made for most or all questions             |
| 1  | submitted, but largely incomplete                      |
| 0  | did not submit                                         |


## Corrections

After receiving the key students will correct any issues with their
assignments. Corrections will be evaluated as follows:

| 1  | Acceptable   |
| 0  | Unacceptable |
