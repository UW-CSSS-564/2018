# Peer Review

After the solutions to each assignment is released, each student will be assigned to review two assignments.

## Instructions

These reviews will be submitted as comments on the pull request.
The comments should address the solution, code, and presentation:

- Solutions:

    - The reviewer should check whether the solutions are correct. A key will be provided.
    - The reviewer should note incorrect or incomplete solutions, along with a suggestion of what they can do to fix it. The reviewer does not need to fix the problems, but they should provide indications of where the solution
    - Note correct solutions.
    - If you are unsure about a solution, note it clearly, and ask the instructors for assistance, or the author for clarification.

- Code:

    - Check that the code runs/compiles; in this class that means "does it knit?". It should run without editing, and produce the results
      presented.
    - If any errors are encountered: include the exact error message as a code block in comments.
    - The code should be clearly written, formatted, and easy to follow.
    - There should not be errors or warnings in the code.

- Presentation:

    - Is the document clearly written, well formatted, such that you as a reviewer can follow and understand the solutions?


## Evaluated.

Each peer review will be deemed “good” or “needs more”.
Each review you do will give you 1 point if is "good" and 0 points if it "needs more".
Those will be totaled over all assignments to form your peer review mark.

How to give good comments:

- Address questions that were answered incorrectly, unclearly, or particularly well.
- Give thoughtful, constructive and considerate comments.
- Be specific and concise.
- Try to learn something new and, if you succeed, point that out.
- If you can’t find anything to praise or that you found helpful, then at least offer some suggestions in a kind way.

Features of "needs more":

- You do not address each question.
- Your review is mean.
- You can’t find anything to praise/learn and yet you don’t offer any suggestions either.

# Corrections

After receiving the key students will correct any issues with their
assignments. Corrections 

--- ----------------------------------
1   Acceptable
0   Uncacceptable
--- ----------------------------------
