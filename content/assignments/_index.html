<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Assignments will be distributed and submitted using GitHub.</p>
<p>Each assignment will have three steps:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Initial submission</li>
<li>Peer review (1 week after initial submission)</li>
<li>Corrections (1 week after peer review)</li>
</ol>
<p>There will be approximately 4–6 assignments.</p>
<div id="initial-submission" class="section level3">
<h3>Initial Submission</h3>
<p>Submissions of all assignments should include both an R Markdown file and a compiled PDF file. Each assignment should be forked from the assignment repository, and submitted with a pull request. More detailed instructions are <a href="https://github.com/UW-CSSS-564/assignment-2018-0">here</a>.</p>
<p>The initial submission will be graded on the following 4-category scale:</p>
<div class="line-block">4 | exceptional, above and beyond what was expected |<br />
3 | effort made to complete all questions; mostly correct |<br />
2 | some effort made for most or all questions |<br />
1 | submitted, but largely incomplete |<br />
0 | did not submit |</div>
</div>
</div>
<div id="peer-review" class="section level2">
<h2>Peer Review</h2>
<p>After the solutions to each assignment is released, each student will be assigned to review two assignments.</p>
<div id="instructions" class="section level3">
<h3>Instructions</h3>
<p>These reviews will be submitted as comments on the pull request.
The comments should address the solution, code, and presentation:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Solutions:</p>
<ul>
<li>The reviewer should check whether the solutions are correct. A key will be provided.</li>
<li>The reviewer should note incorrect or incomplete solutions, along with a suggestion of what they can do to fix it. The reviewer does not need to fix the problems, but they should provide indications of where the solution</li>
<li>Note correct solutions.</li>
<li>If you are unsure about a solution, note it clearly, and ask the instructors for assistance, or the author for clarification.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Code:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Check that the code runs/compiles; in this class that means “does it knit?”. It should run without editing, and produce the results
presented.</p></li>
<li><p>If any errors are encountered: include the exact error message as a code block in comments.</p></li>
<li><p>The code should be clearly written, formatted, and easy to follow.</p></li>
<li><p>There should not be errors or warnings in the code.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Presentation:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is the document clearly written, well formatted, such that you as a reviewer can follow and understand the solutions?</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="evaluation" class="section level3">
<h3>Evaluation</h3>
<p>Each peer review will be deemed “good” or “needs more”.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>
Each review you do will give you 1 point if is “good” and 0 points if it “needs more”.
Those will be totaled over all assignments to form your peer review mark.</p>
<p>How to give good comments:</p>
<ul>
<li>Address questions that were answered incorrectly, unclearly, or particularly well.</li>
<li>Give thoughtful, constructive and considerate comments.</li>
<li>Be specific and concise.</li>
<li>Try to learn something new and, if you succeed, point that out.</li>
<li>If you can’t find anything to praise or that you found helpful, then at least offer some suggestions in a kind way.</li>
</ul>
<p>Features of “needs more”:</p>
<ul>
<li>You do not address each question.</li>
<li>Your review is mean.</li>
<li>You can’t find anything to praise/learn and yet you don’t offer any suggestions either.</li>
</ul>

<div id="corrections" class="section level2">
<h2>Corrections</h2>
<p>After receiving the key students will correct any issues with their
assignments. Corrections will be evaluated as follows:</p>
<div class="line-block">1 | Acceptable |<br />
0 | Unacceptable |</div>
