<div id="instructions" class="section level2">
<h2>Instructions</h2>

The comments should address the solution, code, and presentation:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Solutions:</p>
<ul>
<li>The reviewer should check whether the solutions are correct. A key will be provided.</li>
<li>The reviewer should note incorrect or incomplete solutions, along with a suggestion of what they can do to fix it. The reviewer does not need to fix the problems, but they should provide indications of where the solution</li>
<li>Note correct solutions.</li>
<li>If you are unsure about a solution, note it clearly, and ask the instructors for assistance, or the author for clarification.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Code:</p>
<ul>
<li>Check that the code runs/compiles; in this class that means “does it knit?”. It should run without editing, and produce the results
presented.</li>
<li>If any errors are encountered: include the exact error message as a code block in comments.</li>
<li>The code should be clearly written, formatted, and easy to follow.</li>
<li>There should not be errors or warnings in the code.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Presentation:</p>

</ul></li>
</ul>

<div id="evaluated." class="section level2">
<h2>Evaluated.</h2>
<p>Each peer review will be deemed “good” or “needs more”.
Each review you do will give you 1 point if is “good” and 0 points if it “needs more”.
Those will be totaled over all assignments to form your peer review mark.</p>
<p>How to give good comments:</p>
<ul>
<li>Address questions that were answered incorrectly, unclearly, or particularly well.</li>
<li>Give thoughtful, constructive and considerate comments.</li>
<li>Be specific and concise.</li>
<li>Try to learn something new and, if you succeed, point that out.</li>
<li>If you can’t find anything to praise or that you found helpful, then at least offer some suggestions in a kind way.</li>
</ul>
<p>Features of “needs more”:</p>
<ul>
<li>You do not address each question.</li>
<li>Your review is mean.</li>
<li>You can’t find anything to praise/learn and yet you don’t offer any suggestions either.</li>
</ul>
