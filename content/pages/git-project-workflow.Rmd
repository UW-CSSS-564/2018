```{r setup,include=FALSE}
library("DiagrammeR")
```

For the project assignments, each student has a repository named
`UW-POLS501/:username` where `:username` is the GitHub username of the student.
This does not need to be forked.
The student works directly on that repository, and submits assignments by opening an issue on `UW-POLS501/:username/issue`.

```{r echo=FALSE}
