## What is Git? 

Git is software for version control (keeping track of the changes and history of files).

## What is GitHub? 

GitHub is a website that hosts git repositories. It also has tools to enable
collaboration on software using git.

## Getting Started with Git

RStudio includes a GUI interface to git, which will cover almost all the cases you will encounter in this course.
For quick introduction on  learn how to use Version control within RStudio, I suggest the "Version Control" chapter of the [Working with the RStudio IDE (Part 2)](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/working-with-the-rstudio-ide-part-2) DataCamp course.

However, if you are comfortable with the command line I suggest you learn how
to use git from the command line. See the references below for more information.

## References

There are **many** references/introductions and tutorials on git and GitHub available. 
However, be aware that many of these are written for programmers/software engineers who may have different use-cases for git than you will have working on research in a small team or solo.

Here are a few that I've found useful.
