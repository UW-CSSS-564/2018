## Overview

<img alt="Relationship between git and GitHub" src="../../img/github-diagram.svg">

The above diagram provides an overview of the relationship between these repositories and the workflow.

1. **Forks** the repository `UW-POLS501/assignment-1` to `username/assignment-1` to get a copy of the assignment in their GitHub account.
2. **Clone** the repository to their device.
3. Work on the assignment and commit changes to the repository on their device.
4. **Push** changes to their repository, `UW-POLS501/assignment-1`
5. When ready to submit their assignment, open a **Pull request**

Alternatively, the workflow is represented as:

```{r echo=FALSE}
mermaid("homework-flow.mmd")
```
