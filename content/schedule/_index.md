This schedule may be altered as the needs of the course. 
Students will be informed of changes to the schedule.

Subject to time constraints, I expect to cover the following topics.

- Bayes Theorem
- Conjugate posterior distributions
- Bayesian Inference
- Bayesian computational methods
- Introduction to Stan
- Regression Models
- Diagnosing sampling issues
- Comparing models
- Shrinkage and sparsity in Bayesian Models
- Hierarchical Models
- Measurement models
