readings:
- >-
  *Stan Modeling Language Userâ€™s Guide and Reference Manual: Stan Version 2.17.0*, Sec. 9.11 "Item-Response Theory Models" (p. 142).
- >-
  Jackman, Simon. (2009) *Bayesian Analysis for the Social Sciences*, Ch. 9 "Bayesian Approaches to Measurment". This chapter is a good overview of some common, basic measurement mdoels. Ignore the Gibbs/MCMC estimation details due to the datedness of the source.
- >- 
  Clinton, Joshua, Simon Jackman, and Douglas Rivers. 2004.
  "[The Statistical Analysis of Roll Call Data](http://www.jstor.org/stable/25791782)" 
  This was the first application of Bayesian
  statistical methods to estimating ideal points in political science.
  There have been many innovations since then, but since this article
  was written when many were unfamiliar with Bayesian stats, it will
  provide an good introduction to some of the issues.
- >-
  Quinn, Kevin. (2004) "[Bayesian Factor Analysis for Mixed Ordinal and Continuous Responses](http://www.jstor.org/stable/25791782)" *Political Analysis*
  Ignore the Gibbs sampling method, but note how the different outcomes
  can be modeled.
- >-
  Kruschke. [Bayesian Iterm Response Theory in JAGS](http://doingbayesiandataanalysis.blogspot.com/2015/12/bayesian-item-response-theory-in-jags.html). Ignore the JAGS model. This is a 
  quick introduction to Bayesian IRT models.
- >-
  [edstan](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/edstan/vignettes/briefmanual.html) package vignette. This package
  provides pre-programmed Stan models for common item-response theory models.
