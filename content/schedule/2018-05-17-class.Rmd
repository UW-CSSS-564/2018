week: 8
readings:
- >-
  *BDA3* Ch. 15: "Hierarchical Linear Models"
- >-
  Gabry and Goodrich. [Estimating Generalized (Non-)Linear Models with Group-Specific Terms with rstanarm](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rstanarm/vignettes/glmer.html) 2018.
- >-
  Fonnesbeck. [A Primer on Bayesian Multilevel Modeling using PyStan](http://mc-stan.org/users/documentation/case-studies/radon.html). 2016. *Stan Case Studies*. This uses the Python interface to Stan, but the Stan models are the same, and so is the description. See [this](https://github.com/stan-dev/example-models/tree/master/ARM/Ch.18) for R code of the Radon model.
optional:
- >-
  Stegmueller. "[How many countries for multilevel modeling? a comparison of frequentist and Bayesian approaches](https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ajps.12001)." *American Journal of Political Science.* 2013. 
- >- 
  Rendon. "[Fixed and Random Effects in Classical and Bayesian Regressions](10.1111/j.1468-0084.2012.00700.x)" *Oxford Bulletin of Economics and Statistics*. 2012.
- >-
  Clark and Linzer. "Should I use fixed or random effects?" *[Political Science Research and Methods](https://dx.doi.org/10.1017/psrm.2014.32)* 2014.

- >-
  Bates. *lme4: Mixed-effects modeling with R* 2010. The R package lme4 estimates mixed-effects models using MLE-type methods. This book is also a good introduction to these methods.
- >-
  Burkner. "[Advanced Bayesian Multilevel Modeling with the R package brms](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/brms/vignettes/brms_multilevel.pdf)" and "[brms: An R Package for Bayesian Multilevel Models using Stan](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/brms/vignettes/brms_multilevel.pdf)" The brms package is an alternative to the rstanarm package. Like that package it uses Stan to estimate the models, but provides a user-friendly front-end.
- >-
  Gelman and Hill. *[Data Analysis Using Regression and Multilevel/Hierarchical Models](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/arm/)" 2006. An accessible introduction to these models.
