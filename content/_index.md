## Overview

Statistical methods based on the idea of probability as a measure of uncertainty. Topics covered include subjective notion of probability, Bayes' Theorem, prior and posterior distributions, and data analysis techniques for statistical models.


### Course Goals

By the end of the course students will be able to

### Prerequisites

Students should have completed the introductory quantitative methods sequence appropriate to their programs. They should be familiar with statistical inference, regression methods, and maximum likelihood. 
A course SOC 504, SOC 505, SOC 506 or the 

It will be useful, but not required, for students to have a familiarity with the **R** programming language, or the programming background to learn it quickly. This is a computationally intensive and focused course, and some level of proficiency in programming prior to taking this course.
To learn **R**, I suggest [R for Data Science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/) or [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com/). In particular, this course will heavily use the  [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/) packages (ggplot2, dplyr, ...).


- **Git and GitHub**: We will use git and GitHub for assignments and projects. This was introduced in POLS 501, so you are not familiar with these tools it may take some extra time to familiarize yourself with them

## Assignments

There are three main types of assignments for students:

1.  Weekly homework: Learning data analysis requires practice. There will be weekly homework assignments. See the [assignments](./assignments/) page.
2.  Research project: Students will complete a research project. The expectation is that students will work on the project throughout the quarter and apply concepts and skills to that project soon after covering them in class. See the [project](./projects/) page for more details.
3.  Reading Assignments: Students are expected to come to class prepared. I have chosen textbooks that are accessible, so we will not spend valuable class time summarizing assigned readings. Instead we will use class for more value-added learning activities. As part of that, before each class students will provide feedback and questions on the readings that will be used to guide class in-class discussion.


## Materials


### Computational Tools

Students should have a laptop that they can bring to both class and lab as we will integrate computing with learning data analysis and statistics throughout the course.

This course will use [R](https://www.r-project.org/), which is a free and open-source programming language primarily used for statistics and data analysis. We will also use [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/), which is an easy-to-use interface to R.
Instructions to install or upgrade R are [here](./pages/install/).

This course will also use [git](https://git-scm.com/) (through RStudio)
for version control, which is like "track changes" for a directory of files, in reproducible research.
Homework assignments will be distributed and submitted via [GitHub](https://github.com/), which is a website that hosts git repositories.
If that did not make sense, don't worry; we'll cover it in the course.

Students will have access to [DataCamp classroom](https://www.datacamp.com/groups/education). You can use this for additional practice.

## Evaluation


## Communication

For questions regarding the content of the course, ask and answer them on our [Slack](https://uwpolsmethods.slack.com/) channel.
If you have a question about the topic, it is likely that someone else had the same question.
Posting questions and answers publicly allows us all to learn from each of these questions and answers.

Reserve emails to the instructors for personal matters.

### Resources

Beyond what the teaching team can provide, there are several resources on campus that you can go to for assistance with data, computing, and statistical problems:

-   Center for Social Science Computing and Research ([CSSCR](http://julius.csscr.washington.edu)) has a drop-in statistical consulting center in Savery 119. They provide consulting on statistical software, e.g. R. Go there for software or data related questions.
-   [CSSS](https://csss.washington.edu) [Statistical Consulting](https://csss.washington.edu/consulting) provides general statistical consulting. Go there for questions about statistical methods.
-   [eScience Data Science Office Hours](http://escience.washington.edu/office-hours/)
