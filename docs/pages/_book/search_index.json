Git is software for version control (keeping track of the changes and history of files). 0.2 What is GitHub? GitHub is a website that hosts git repositories. It also has tools to enable collaboration on software using git. 0.3 Getting Started with Git RStudio includes a GUI interface to git, which will cover almost all the cases you will encounter in this course. For quick introduction on learn how to use Version control within RStudio, I suggest the “Version Control” chapter of the Working with the RStudio IDE (Part 2) DataCamp course. However, if you are comfortable with the command line I suggest you learn how to use git from the command line. See the references below for more information. 0.4 Relationship between GitHub and Local Git Projects 0.5 References There are many references/introductions and tutorials on git and GitHub available. However, be aware that many of these are written for programmers/software engineers who may have different use-cases for git than you will have working on research in a small team or solo. Here are a few that I’ve found useful. Jenny Bryan, Happy Git and GitHub for the useR DataCamp course Version Control with Git. This course requires shell knowledge, but the following two modules are useful. Automated Version Control Using Git from RStudio Try Git Software Carpentry: Version Control with Git Simple guide to forks in GitHub and Git GitHub Help Git and GitHub videos for beginners from dataschool introduces git and GitHub via many videos. Git Cheat Sheet A good place to start is Rstudio’s guide for getting help with R 0.6 Asking for Help When asking for help with R it is important to at least Include the exact code that you ran The error message that you got Without the code and the error message it can be hard to impossible to diagnose the problem and provide a solution. Questions such as “This isn’t working” or even “I’m getting this error message” aren’t useful without the code and error message. Even better is to provide a minimal reproducible answer. This is the smallest amount of code that someone else can run, that produces the same error that you are getting. This often means trying to reproduce your error running the same code on a different built-in data set and seeing if you still get the same error. See more instructions here. A benefit of this approach, is that often by trying to reproduce with minimal code you will be able to debug the code itself. Finally, include the results of sessionInfo(). This provides information about the exact versions of R, loaded packages, and operating system you are using, which can be useful in debugging problems. sessionInfo() ## R version 3.5.0 (2018-04-23) ## Platform: x86_64-apple-darwin15.6.0 (64-bit) ## Running under: macOS High Sierra 10.13.4 ## ## Matrix products: default ## BLAS: /System/Library/Frameworks/Accelerate.framework/Versions/A/Frameworks/vecLib.framework/Versions/A/libBLAS.dylib ## LAPACK: /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/3.5/Resources/lib/libRlapack.dylib ## ## locale: ## [1] en_US.UTF-8/en_US.UTF-8/en_US.UTF-8/C/en_US.UTF-8/en_US.UTF-8 ## ## attached base packages: ## [1] stats graphics grDevices utils datasets methods base ## ## other attached packages: ## [1] fortunes_1.5-4 testthat_2.0.0 rmarkdown_1.9 knitr_1.20 ## [5] roxygen2_6.0.1 devtools_1.13.5 ## ## loaded via a namespace (and not attached): ## [1] Rcpp_0.12.16 rstudioapi_0.7 xml2_1.2.0 magrittr_1.5 ## [5] R6_2.2.2 rlang_0.2.0 stringr_1.3.0 tools_3.5.0 ## [9] xfun_0.1 withr_2.1.2 htmltools_0.3.6 commonmark_1.5 ## [13] yaml_2.1.18 rprojroot_1.3-2 digest_0.6.15 bookdown_0.7 ## [17] memoise_1.1.0 evaluate_0.10.1 blogdown_0.6 stringi_1.1.7 ## [21] compiler_3.5.0 backports_1.1.2 For further discussion on how to ask good questions: How to ask for help in R StackOverflow.

What Have You Tried? 0.7 Getting Help from Within R and RStudio Help tab: The first place to look is to use the search box in the Help tab of RStudio. Autocompletion: If you start typing in either the console or editor in RStudio and hit [TAB], the RStudio will show a list of completions as well as a short help for each. There are several R functions to get help. You can use either ? or help. For example to find help for a function quantile, both ?quantile and help(&quot;quantile&quot;) will display the help page for quantile. To view this documentation online in a searchable form visit Rdocumentation.org. To find the help pages available for a package, use help with the package argument. For example, help(package = &quot;tidyr&quot;) The help for R functions is only useful if you know what function you need want to know either what it is doing, or what the arguments are. The help files in R are not useful for understanding what a package does or how to use it. However, vignettes for R packages are often overviews of the functionality of packages that serve as tutorials or introductions to using the package. To get a list of all vignettes of the packages your have installed, run browseVignettes() To get the list of vignettes for a specific package, run browseVignettes(&quot;dplyr&quot;) You can also find vignettes for packages you have not installed on the packages’ CRAN page https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tidyr/index.html. There is also a vignette function, but you need the exact name of the vignette, which you generally do not know. You can search for foo in help manuals and archived mailing lists RSiteSearch(&quot;ggplot2&quot;) Want to find out what data sets are included in the R packages that you have installed? data() To find data sets included in a specific package, use data with the package argument, For example, data(package = &quot;ggplot2&quot;) Note that search() does not do what you expect it to do (unless you expect it to return the search path in which R looks for names of functions and objects). 0.8 Help on the Internet Rdocumentation.org searches the documentation of all R packages on CRAN. There are several documentation sites that are of particular use: tidyverse.org hosts documentation for the various tidyverse packages (ggplot2, tibble, tidyr, reader, purr, dplyr, …). ggplot2 documentation. Documentation for ggplot2. ggplot2 extensions A list of packages that extend the functionality of ggplot2. Google has gotten better with R searches, but R is a particularly unfriendly search term. However, if you are searching for “R” with other words in context, you are likely to have some success. An alternative is to use rseek.org instead. It is a Google search restricted to a curated set of sites related to R. Many R packages have an article in either the Journal of Statistical Software or The R Journal These articles are similar to package does. Stack Overflow is a question and answer website for computer programming questions. Search for questions about R using the “r” tag. You can do this by adding [r] to your search query. Other tags that may be useful are [ggplot2], [plyr]. However, generally you should not need to ask questions for this course. Someone has likely already asked your question before. If you have a question about “statistics” or “data analysis” rather than “R”, then Cross Validated is a Q-and-A site like Stack Overflow, but for statistics and machine learning. The traditional source of R help was the R-help mailing list. It is still a useful resource, though much of the traffic has moved over to StackOverflow. 0.9 R Cheatsheets RStudio has man very good cheatsheets. The most relevant to this course are: RStudio IDE Data Visualization Data Transformation Cheat Sheet R Markdown R Markdown Reference Guide Data Import Cheat Sheet Base R Advanced R Regular Expressions The Short R Reference Card is the classic cheatsheet. However, some of the data manipulation and plotting functions are not those we use in this course, but it does cover much of the statistical functions. 0.10 Books Two references organized by task are The Cookbook for R and Quick-R. 0.11 Blogs and Twitter R-bloggers aggregates R-related blogging. 0.12 Task Views Do you want to know what packages exist for a given topic? CRAN Task Views provide subject matter groupings of R packages. Some potentially useful task-views to social scientists are: Econometrics Natural Language Processing Official Statistics &amp; Survey Methodology Reproducible Research Spatial Survival Analysis Time Series Web Technologies and Services Social Sciences Please complete the following before the first day of class (Tuesday, March 27, 2018). Sign up for our Slack worplace, https://uwcsss564.slack.com. We will use this for announcments, and asking and answering questions in this course. You should have received an invite. If not email the instructors to receive one. Sign into the course Slack workplace https://uwcsss564.slack.com, and leave a message on the #onboarding channel. In the message introduce yourself, explain why you are taking this course, and what you hope to get out of taking this course. Tell use about yourself: Complete the pre-course survey. If you are registered for the course, you should have received an email. kIf not, you can find a link pinned on the #onboarding channel of Slack. We will use git for version control. and GitHub for distributing, collecting, and commenting on assignments. Download Git and install git. You should be able to use defaults for all settings. Sign up for a GitHub account at https://github.com (if you do no already have one). Tell us what your GitHub username is using the form emailed to you, or that can be found pinned on the #onboarding channel in Slack. Download that you have installed and downloaded R: If you have R installed already, check have the latest version of R. At the start of this course, the most recent version of R is 3.4.4. You can find this in R: $ sessionInf() If you do not have R or the latest version of it installed, then download it from CRAN. Update all installed R packages, $ update.packages(ask = FALSE) Download that install RStudio Desktop (Open Source Edition). RStudio provides a friendly interface to R (an IDE). (If you are proficient with R and have been using another IDE or text editor with R, you can skip this step.) If you do not have RStudio installed, download and install it from here. If you already have RStudio installed, check that you have the latest version by selecting Help &gt; Check for Updates in the menu. Download and install the newest version if not. Install LaTeX. We will not use LaTeX directly. But we will use it to create PDFs from R Markdown files. If you do not have LaTeX installed on your machine, download and install a LaTeX distribution. There are many different distributions, but these are the ones common to each distribution. Windows: MikTex MacOS: MacTex Linux: tex-live is the most common LaTeX distribution. Install it using your distribution’s package manager. Note, these are very large files and can take a while to download. The final project will a short analysis in R markdown that implements a Bayesian model using Stan to answer a research question of the student’s choosing. 0.13 Proposal Fork https://github.com/UW-CSSS-564/2018-research-project. Edit the README.md. Add your name, correct the title, and make any other appropriate customizations. Write your proposal in the document docs/proposal.Rmd. Submit the assignment by opening a pull request titled, “Review Proposal”. The project proposal should be brief. The intent of the proposal is two-fold: Encourage the student to think about the project with enough time to implement it. Receive feedback early in order to avoid projects that will be unfeasible in the context of this course. The proposal sould consist of a paragraph or two describing. State research question Describe data that will be used to answer that question. Describe the model to be estimated to the best of your current understanding. Forecast anticipated problems with the project: data availability, data size, model complexity, etc. Other notes on this proposal: You should have data on hand. There is not enough time to collect new data before this is due. Replications are acceptable. However, you must do some original work when replicating a paper. 0.14 Draft This is a draft of the final research project. This will consistent of whatever the student is able to produce at the time of the due date. We will spend the last week working on these projects so the intent of having a draft prior to that week is not to have a complete draft, but to provide an opportunity for the student to document the current state of the project from which instructors and peers can provide feedback. The student should write up whatever they have done, and their plans, in such a way to provide others the best possibility to provide feedback. 0.15 Final Research Project Submission of the final research project. See Instructions. 0.16 Instructions The final project should produce a computational narrative in R markdown which answers a relevant research problem using methods introduced in this course. A [computational narrative] is a document which combines prose, code, and visualizations to explain and communicate scientific results. Unlike a traditional article, the code and data producing the results transparently presented in the document itself. The Stan Case Studies provide good exemplars of this style. This course asks requires a computational essay instead of an article in order to focus the students’ attention on the methodology, computation, and reproducibility issues which this course should promote. The submission will consist of an R markdown document compiled into either a PDF or HTML file (if the document contains interactive material) and a repository containing the data and code necessary to reproduce the analysis. The details of this process are described in the final project details. The computational narrative should be no longer than a research note in a political science journal, 5,000 words of text (excluding code). The computational narrative should be self contained and written for a general social science audience. The computational narrative should effectively and informatively communicate its research design, methods, and contribution using text, code, and visualizations. The computational narrative should include no unnecessary material. The computational narrative must address an research problem or question using the appropriate methodology and design incorporating methods introduced and discussed in this course. As with any project worked on during graduate school, the author should use it to further research that could lead to a publication. However, given the time constraints of the quarter, it is recognized that it may not be possible to develop a novel contribution to a body of knowledge. Thus, projects will be primarily assessed on the appropriate application of methodology while taking the question as given. Replications of existing papers are acceptable provided that the author conducts their own analysis. It is acceptable to use this work in other courses. It is possible to collaborate on this assignment, but it requires pre-approval of the instructor. The computational narrative should not include a lengthy discussion of previous literature. But if it makes an original contribution it should clearly identify a gap in this literature and state the original contribution. Citations should use the citation capabilities in R markdown; see the R markdown documentation. Projects will not be judged on their results. They will be judged on the appropriateness of Bayesian methods used to answer the question. The use of visualization to convey results is preferable to tables or the printed output of code. Equations and formulas are important for the presentation of statistical arguments. Authors should make the mathematical presentation as clear as possible. Clear and consistent notation and formatting of equations should be used. All symbols used in equations need to be clearly defined. To ensure readability of the paper, authors should choose a notation that makes the argument as easy to follow as possible. Equations are part of the text and thus they should contain appropriate punctuation. Equations should be numbered consecutively, with sub-numbering used as appropriate, e.g. equations 1a and 1b. Mathematical notation should use the appropriate R markdown math capabilities. See this for an introduction. To the extent possible, variable names should be readable and clearly denote what the variable is. Provide clear a descriptions of the data and the context necessary to understand the data. A non-expert reader should be able to understand the meaning and scale of the relevant variables and important features of the analysis. 0.16.1 Advice As in any graduate courses, strive to produce analysis that could lead to a publishable article.1 The main focus of the computational narrative should be on data, methods, and results. Justify your modeling choices with reference to theory. Present findings in terms any intelligent person could understand, regardless of their statistical knowledge. This should not limit the sophistication of your methods. It does require you to explain results from complicated models in approachable terms. Do not spend too much time on literature reviews or theory, but do not neglect hypothesis building. Hypotheses can be clearly explicated without recourse to numbered lists. The the time the reader reaches the results, they should know what to expect, what would be surprising, and why. Research that ask substantively important, interesting, novel, or controversial questions are better—potentially much better—than research that do not, all else equal. Papers that explain their empirical findings in ways non-specialists can understand are better than papers that do not, all else equal. Model specifications informed by test statistics, substantive knowledge and theory are better than model specifications based solely on test statistics, all else equal. 0.16.2 Reproducibility Code must run without error and successfully replicate. The repository must contain a REAMDE.md file which describes the contents of the repositories, software and data dependencies and installation instructions, and instructions on how to reproduce the analysis. If the analysis requires data too large to include in the repository, instructions on how to obtain the necessary must be included. If possible, a script to automate the process is preferred. If the analysis uses data that cannot be distributed for privacy or intellectual property reasons, it must be documented. The student must discuss with the instructor prior to submission. 0.16.3 Organization The repository must be organized as an R project. To the extent possible, good scientific practices should be followed, as outlined in [Good enough practices in scientific computing] (http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005510). Do not use of absolute paths in the code. See this post for a discussion of this. Use the here package to Do not use install.packages in the computational narrative. Instructions on installing dependencies should go in the README.md or a separate script. Include a code chunk at the top of the R markdown document which loads the packages which will be used. Include a code chunk at the end of the R markdown document which includes information from sessionInfo() to document the original computational environment. Do not include unnecessary output (e.g. extraneous print statement) or messages. Each piece of code and output in the computational narrative should serve some purpose toward communicate the research. 0.16.4 Computational Narratives A computational narrative is a document that combines text, code, and code output to communicate a data analysis or scientific research. R markdown is one program that can be used to produce computational narratives. Even if students are familiar with statistics and programming, they may be less familiar with computational narratives than with the format of journal articles and books. The following references provide some discussion of computational narratives. Many of these references Jupyter, a similar, Python-based tool to produce notebooks. The state of Jupyter: How Project Jupyter got here and where we are headed Fernando Perez and Brian E. Granger (2015) Project Jupyter: Computational Narratives as the Engine of Collaborative Data Science Programming, meh … Let’s Teach How to Write Computational Essays Instead What is a Computational Essay? “Literate computing” and computational reproducibility: IPython in the age of data-driven journalism Since students may not have seen computational narratives, the following examples are provided. Most of them are produced by R markdown. Some are produced by the Python program Jupyter. These are not meant to be definitive guides for how to structure your computational narrative. Many of these were produced for different purposes than the project for this course. However, they do provide examples of effectively combining text, code, and output to communicate data analysis. Stan Case Studies are generally well formatted examples of this style.
