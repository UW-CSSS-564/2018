      <description>A good place to start is Rstudio’s guide for getting help with R
Asking for Help When asking for help with R it is important to at least
Include the exact code that you ran The error message that you got  Without the code and the error message it can be hard to impossible to diagnose the problem and provide a solution. Questions such as “This isn’t working” or even “I’m getting this error message” aren’t useful without the code and error message.</description>

      <description>What is Git? Git is software for version control (keeping track of the changes and history of files).
 What is GitHub? GitHub is a website that hosts git repositories. It also has tools to enable collaboration on software using git.
 Getting Started with Git RStudio includes a GUI interface to git, which will cover almost all the cases you will encounter in this course. For quick introduction on learn how to use Version control within RStudio, I suggest the “Version Control” chapter of the Working with the RStudio IDE (Part 2) DataCamp course.</description>
