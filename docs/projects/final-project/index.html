  <h1>Project</h1>

  <p>
    <strong>Due Date:</strong> March 16, 2018 4:30 pm
  </p>

  <p>Answer a research question using the statistical and computational methods used in this course.
It can be a descriptive, predictive, or causal question.
What is important for this reports is that the question and stated clearly, the methods and data used to answer the question are described clearly, and a discussion of why the methods and data used to answer the question are appropriate, and a discusison of th assumptions made by those methods and the limits of what we can learn from this research.</p>
<div id="submission" class="section level2">
<h2>Submission</h2>
<p>Open a new issue in your project repo, <code>UW-POLS501/username</code>, titled <code>Final Project Submission</code>. Assign it to <code>@jrnold</code>.</p>
</div>
<div id="format" class="section level2">
<h2>Format</h2>
<p>The format of the project is as a reproducible R markdown documentin your course github repository, e.g. <code>UW-POLS501/username</code>.
All data and code necessary to reproduce the analyses presented in the paper must be provided. The data and analyses should be well documented and understandable to a reader. In particular, it should be clear how the code relates to the analyses presented in the paper. The analysis code must run and reproduce the analyses as presented in the paper.</p>
<p>You should have a file named <code>README.md</code> in the root of project with the following format:</p>
<pre><code># Title of your project

A few lines about what is in the repository.

# Dependencies

Describe what steps someone would need to take in order to run your code.
This includes listing the packages you use, preferrably with the necessary code:
\`\`\`
packages_used &lt;- c(&quot;tidyverse&quot;)
install.packages(packages_used)
\`\`\`

Does the user need to download specific files not included in the repository in order to be able to replicate your analysis?


# Instructions

After installing any dependencies, what should a user do to replicate your code.

- What R scripts must be run in what order? 
- What R Markdown files should be knit? 

This may be as simple as saying open up `somefile.Rmd` and knit.


# Organization

Describe the organization of your project. 

- What is in each directory? 
- What are the important files? 

You should also delete any extraneous or unneeded files.</code></pre>
<p>Your R Markdown file MUST:</p>
<ul>
<li>knit successfully</li>
<li>have chunk describing all libraries used near the top of the document</li>
<li>the output of <code>sessionInfo</code> at the end of the file</li>
<li>no extraneous error messages, warnings, or overly verbose output (e.g. printing 1,000 rows of a data frame).</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="content" class="section level2">
<h2>Content</h2>
<p>Your project should effectively combine prose, code, and results to answer a research question.</p>
<ul>
<li>If a descriptive question: How do your methods measure something that wasn’t obvious before?</li>
<li><p>If a predictive question:</p>
<ul>
<li>How do you measure out-of-sample errors? Is is consistent with the predictions you would like to make?</li>
<li>What is your out-of-sample error? How does your model compare with alternatives?</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>If a causal inference question:</p>
<ul>
<li>What research design are you using? What are the assumptions of this design?</li>
<li>You are encouraged to use confidence intervals to present results, and discouraged from using p-values.</li>
<li>You must discuss the magnitude (substantive signficance) of your results.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>What are the properties of your sample? How generalizable is it?</li>
<li>What are the assumptions of your research design? How plausible are they? What would be needed to improve on your research design?</li>
<li><p>Use visualizations where possible to describe your results</p></li>
</ul>
